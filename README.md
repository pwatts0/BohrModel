# BohrModel
A simulation of excited electron states in the hydrogen atom as predicted by the Bohr model.
The user inputs a value n that indicates the final position of the electron orbiting the hydrogen nucleus(a proton). 
The electron then moves to that orbit and emits a photon of a wavelength depending on the energy released from the transition.
