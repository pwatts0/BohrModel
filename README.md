# BohrModel
A simulation of excited electron states in the hydrogen atom as predicted by the Bohr model.
The user inputs positive integer values that indicate the final and initial positions of the electron orbiting the hydrogen nucleus(a proton). 
The electron then makes the transition and emits a photon of a wavelength depending on the energy released from the transition.
